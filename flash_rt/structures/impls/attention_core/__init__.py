def bind_dense_attention_best(captures, *, prefer=()):
    """Dense attention across the variant family, precision-descending.

    One structure, parallel executable forms, and no second hardware
    table: each variant's kernel package declares its own archs (or
    ships build variants only for the hosts it serves), so the device
    split *is* the refusal machinery. The order is precision first:
    FA2 (BF16, numerics preserving) binds wherever its runtime
    executes — every current receipt keeps its exact form. Then the
    FA4 CuTe DSL form (BF16, the SM100-family hot path), the
    allocation-free masked MHA (BF16/FP16, batch-of-one sites), and
    last the FP8 FA4 form. All are judged by the same downstream
    gates; a device none serves keeps the host's own attention.

    The winner carries the trail: ``_frt_variant`` names the bound
    form and ``_frt_variant_trail`` holds what each preferred variant
    said when it stepped aside. Without that, a host whose preferred
    package is merely absent looks identical to one where it was
    weighed and rejected — the two need different fixes, and only the
    trail tells them apart.

    ``prefer`` names forms to try ahead of that order, and is empty by
    default because the order above is a precision order: the quantized
    forms trade a bounded error for speed, which is a decision about the
    deployment rather than about the device, and a device-shaped ladder
    is the wrong place to make it. A caller that has judged the trade —
    a host binding, a qualification run — names the form it wants and
    gets the same qualification walk, speed gate and trail as any other
    rung. An unknown name is a caller error, not a silent no-op.
    """
    # a package can refuse a device three ways: its arch declaration
    # (ValueError from the loader's metadata check), the kernels
    # library finding no build variant for the host (OSError), or a
    # bind smoke the runtime cannot execute (RuntimeError) — each
    # means "not this variant here", never an error for the family.
    # ImportError/AttributeError cover a fourth, packaging-side case:
    # an artifact whose wrapper cannot import against the installed
    # DSL version. Same verdict — this variant is not on this host —
    # and the next rung gets weighed.
