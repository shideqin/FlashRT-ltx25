"""LTX-2.5 FFN swap: upstream NVFP4Linear pair -> FlashRT W4A4 CUTLASS chain.

Upstream FeedForward runs six launches per call (activation quantize +
cuBLASLt + bias, torch GELU, activation quantize + cuBLASLt + bias). The
FlashRT chain runs three:

    quantize_bf16_to_nvfp4_swizzled(x)
    fp4_w4a16_gemm_bias_gelu_fp4out_sm120   (up proj + bias + tanh-GELU + fp4)
    fp4_w4a16_gemm_sm120_bf16out            (down proj)  [+ add_bias]

Weights are repacked once per build from the checkpoint's NVFP4 layout
(dequantize to bf16, requantize into the fvk swizzled layout); the original
parameters are dropped right after so resident memory stays flat. Measured on
block-0 weights at the model's real M sizes this is 1.25-1.28x the upstream
pair at equivalent accuracy against a bf16 golden reference.

All launches take raw pointers on preallocated buffers -- safe to record into
a CUDA graph.
